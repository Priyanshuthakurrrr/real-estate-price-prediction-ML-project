# real-estate-price-prediction-ML-project
This project focuses on predicting real estate prices using machine learning regression techniques.
The goal is to understand how different property-related features influence housing prices and to build a predictive model using scikit-learn.

The project demonstrates the end-to-end ML workflow, from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation.

Objectives:-
Analyze factors affecting real estate prices,
Perform data preprocessing and feature handling,
Build and train regression-based ML models,
Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics,
Understand the importance of feature engineering in prediction accuracy

The project follows these steps:
-Data Loading & Exploration
-Understanding the dataset structure
-Identifying relevant features
-Data Preprocessing
-Handling missing values
-Feature scaling and transformation
-Preparing data for model training
-Model Building
-Implemented regression-based models using scikit-learn
-Trained models on processed data
-Model Evaluation
-Compared predictions with actual values
-Evaluated performance using error metrics
